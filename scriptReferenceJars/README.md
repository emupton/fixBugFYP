# Script Reference Jars #

## Overview ##

These Jars represent components of the system that are executed by the unified shell script in sequence

## CppCheckParser.jar ##

Takes as input a file path for an XML file that contains XML generated by `cppcheck`. It then outputs the serialisation of a `Bug` object containing relevant information to the bug `cppcheck` has detected to a filepath specified in the command line arguments passed to it.

**Argument 1:** The bug descriptor XML file location  
**Argument 2:** The output location for the serialisation of the Bug object.

**Example: ** `java -jar CppCheckParser.jar "cppcheckoutput.xml" "bug.ser"`

## ScanBuildParser.jar ##
Performs a similar function to CppCheckParser.jar but takes in as input the HTML bug report files generated from `scan-build`. It also outputs a serialisation of a `Bug` object generated from information extracted from the HTML bug report.

However, due to constraints in the data that can be obtained from a `scan-build` bug report, the original source file must be specified to the parser as an argument too.

**Argument 1:** The bug report HTML file location  
**Argument 2:** The problem (.C) source file  
**Argument 3:** The output location for the serialisation of the Bug object.

**Example:** `java -jar "bugreport.html" "sourcefile.c" "bug.ser"`

## CentralSys.jar ##
This takes in as input the serialisation of a `Bug` object and from that obtains information about the nature of the bug in the source file and will then apply fixes to the code that are then outputted to a specified output file location.

**Argument 1:** The bug .ser file  
**Argument 2:** The output file path for the fixed file

**Example:** `java -jar "bug.ser" "sourcefilefix.c"`
